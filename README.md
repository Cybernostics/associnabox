AssocInABox
==========

Cake PHP site for managing a club handling membership, meetings, forums and CMS

AssocInABox was conceived when I was Secretary at a local primary school parents' association. There seemed to be a lot of time spent doing repetetive
tasks like preparing agendas and minutes and remembering to send reminder emails to track open actions.

We also have a facebook group and a Google Drive (which sadly doesn't permit
easy publishing of html content) so I figured it was time to bring it all under one site and add membership management with optional payments into the mix.

So, when it's done AssocInABox will:
  + allow registration of new members
  + manage membership renewal
  + allow regular and one-off payments to the association
  + manage club/association meetings/agenda/minutes
  + remind members of open actions
  + allow a facebook-style forum for member discussions
  + provide a CMS for posting new club information
  + provide a search engine for club stuff
  + provide a calendar of events
  + provide an internal recurrent calendar for admin - what needs to happen when
  + polls to get membership feedback

I'm using CakePHP as the bedrock on which to build this and hopefully utilise several nice plugins. Will aim to have it packaged to use composer.

That's the idea anyway.

Pull requests welcome once I get the initial codebase in.
